Nowadays, Covid-19 has affected our lives in such a way that we may be asked for not to enter or leave
a place due to not taking the appropriate precaution regarding the virus.

    In your home, business or place you have to look after your health and your own's, so 
    getting a mask detector for telling whether it is safe that each person goes in or not looks
    really usable for these current times, given that wearing a mask is the basic precaution.

    A model is built so that it recognizes if a person has its mask (regarding COVID-19) on
    and indicates that it is safe to be around this person, depending on wearing the mask.

**Deep learning algorithm using keras is built on 'model.ipynb' file and 
the live predictions on the video stream input are displayed on 'covid19-safe-or-not.ipynb' file.**
