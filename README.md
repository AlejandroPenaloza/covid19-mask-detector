# covid19-mask-detector
**Program which will let you know whether it is safe or not to let a person be around**

A model is built so that it recognizes if a person has its mask (regarding COVID-19) on
and indicates that it is safe to be around this person, depending on wearing the mask.

**Deep learning algorithm using keras is built on 'model.ipynb' file and 
the live predictions on the video stream input are displayed on 'covid19-safe-or-not.ipynb' file.**
